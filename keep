       Regular physical activity can improve your<br> muscle strength and boost your<br>
         endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen
         <br> and nutrients to your tissues and
         <br> helps your cardiovascular system
         <br> work more efficiently. And when your heart
           <br> and lung health improve, you<br>
           have more energy to tackle daily<br> 
           chores.


           Two or three 20 or 30 minutes of<br>
            strength training sessions every week<br>
             can result in significant health<br>
              benefits: Increased muscle mass:<br>
               Muscle mass naturally decreases with<br>
                age, but strength training can help<br>
                 reverse the trend. Stronger bones:<br>
                  Strength training increases bone<br>
                   density and reduces the risk of<br>
                    fractures.




                    A gym session or brisk walk can help.<br>
                     Physical activity stimulates various<br>
                      brain chemicals that may leave you<br> 
                      feeling happier, more relaxed, and<br>
                       less anxious. You may also feel better<br>
                        about your appearance and yourself<br> 
                        when you exercise regularly, which<br>
                       can boost your confidence and<br>
                        improve your self-esteem.


Sitting in a steam room might<br>
 significantly make improvement in<br>
  your cardiovascular health. A study of<br>
   older individuals showed that moist<br>
    heat improved circulation, especially<br>
     in extremities. Improved circulation<br>
      can lead to lowered blood pressure<br>
       and a healthier heart. It can also<br>
       promote the healing of broken skin<br>
        tissue.


        Being educated while exercising is<br>
         essential in maximizing effectiveness<br>
          and reducing the risk of injury. A<br>
           personal trainer will teach you<br>
            everything you need to know about<br>
             exercising. They will put together the<br>
              perfect routine to help you achieve<br>
               your goals, demonstrate the correct<br>
                posture for each exercise.
